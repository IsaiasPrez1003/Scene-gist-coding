In the foreground to the right of the camp, we see more trees and the mountain continues to go up. In the background on the left, we can see another mountain, full of green pine trees.

The wooden seawall of this canal rises up to a street with a car on it, and across the street, there are some larger buildings. These buildings are houses I believe, and they are painted vibrantly, alternating between a bright blue and orange. There are about two houses visible across the street, and one orange house on the seawall side. Behind the orange house, they have a dock with a boat on it.

The wave is spiraling, with white along where it crashes and there appears to be maybe 5-6 surfers catching the wave, on brightly colored yellow and green surf boards. The image was framed to where we are entirely focused on the water, and the shore was not in sight. In the wave on the left, behind the surfers, there is a large, blurry grayish-brown shape, which I think is a shark (but for the surfers sake I hope is a dolphin)\u00a0",

To the back wall on the right, we see a long black bench, and on the ceiling above that, a fluorescent light also painted black, with an angular frame. The left side of the room is empty, aside from a large, bold O painted in white on the wall. I think the circle was shaped more like a sideways 0.\u00a0",

The boardwalk comes from the left of the scene, to the first cabana on the center right, and then goes off left into the background, where there is another, unlit cabana. The scene is mostly dark, aside from the red and orange party lights of the cabana that reflect into the nearby water, or the dots of light illuminating the walkway. These structures are on top of the water, which expands much further than they do, into the horizon, and there appears to be land in the background, to the left and right.\u00a0",

This is a picture of a very young child wearing a large, protective wool jacket, which creates a cylindrical shape  around the body, doming at the top, with thick round sleeves and probably allowing for little freedom to move. This jacket is mostly white, with beige and gray detailing. There are black symbols on the front, and based on these and the child's facial features, he appears to be east or southeast asian descent.

In the center, in the valleys of the surrounding mountains, we see two light blue mountain pools, maybe from melting ice.

The waterway is seen splitting the the scene to the left and right, both with the same brick architecture and white detailing. There are a couple bridges throughout with people scattered about, and in the back, we see the waterway begin to open up and expand. ",
